            <h2>Super powerful lord in univers</h2>
            <p>An excellent piece of divine animation.  The narration, language, presentation and  colourful gokul, vrindavan and other places shown are really captivating.  The central theme of the episodes, Lord Krishna is very much convincing as far as his divine and mischiveous natures are concerned..  His friends and their pranks  are also equally unforgetable and the producers of the animation have done total justice to the theme of Bhagavatham in a wonderful manner, which leaves an indelible impression in the minds of the viewers regarding the charming,  mysterious divine  blue boy  and his equally lucky friends. I thank the producers immensely. </p>
